ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @adejota. I'm a web developer!
ðŸ’» These are some technologies I've been working with recently: Javascript, Vue.js, Tailwind.css, Node.js, Express.

I'm working since 2016 and have been in the technology field since 2020. I have always worked close to the decision-making process and business logic.
I worked at the pre-seed in two startups where I contributed with ideas and processes. At the company I currently work for I convinced my superiors about the importance of automated tests and I was primarily responsible for their implementation.
In my personal projects I am focused on solving some problems of my daily life, such as controlling the shared tasks at home, the time I wear my eye contact lenses and my training routine throughout the week.
Iâ€™m currently studying unit tests with Jest and e2e tests with Cypress.

Here's my [portfolio](https://adejota-portfolio.netlify.app/), feel free to get in touch! ðŸ˜‰
